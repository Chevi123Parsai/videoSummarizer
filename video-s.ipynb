In the previous module, we started discussions on introducing relational model. We will conclude that in this module. So, in the last module we have talked about attributes, relational schemas and instances in mathematical form and very importantly we have tried to introduce discuss about the concept of keys. In this module, we will try to understand more on the relational algebra and familiarize with the operations of relational algebra. So, these are the different operations that we will look at select project union and so on. Some of them are simple set theoretic operations, some are newly defined operations and we look at the aggregators. So, relational operators. So, what is a relation? As we have seen already, a relation is nothing but a table. It has a set of columns and it has a set of rows or records that fill up data according to those columns. Select is an operation which chooses a subset of rows from a relation based on a certain condition. So, it is written in terms of in relational algebra we write it with a notion of notation of sigma and following a parenthesis, we put the name of the relation. So, we say we are selecting from the relation r and then we put a condition here which is a propositional condition. So, if for this all rows of r will be checked if a row will satisfy this condition, then it will be included in the result. If it does not satisfy the condition, then it will not be included in the result. So, let us look at this example. So, our condition is sorry let us put this back. So, our condition theta is a is equal to b and d is greater than 5. So, you are saying that that any row to be selected the value of its a attribute should equal the value of its b attribute and when that happens the value of its d attribute must be greater than 5. So, you can easily if we look through this we can easily say by the first condition a equal to b can say that this row does not satisfy this condition because a is alpha and b is beta. Whereas, these three rows satisfy because a is equal to beta, then we again look at d. We find that this d is less than 5. We say this also does not satisfy because it fails the second condition both have to hold. So, we finally come to the this record and this record are the selected record in the result alpha alpha 1 7 alpha alpha 1 7 beta beta 23 10 beta beta 23 10. In both of these records a is equal to b in both of these records d is greater than 5. So, selection is a process is a operation which selects a subset of rows from a table from a relation and creates a new relation based on a selection condition that must be true for all the rows for all the records that have been selected. But the set of columns do not change they remain the same. So, for example, if I if in the contrary if we say that sigma a not equal to b r, then naturally I will have a relation which feels a b c d and that relation will be only this row because as the only row where is not equal to b. We can I can have a selection saying r where c is greater than 0. Naturally this will satisfy this will satisfy this will satisfy this will satisfy. So, this whole relation would be the result of the selection. So, it is possible that it is not necessary that some rows will have to get eliminated in the result. I say that this is is the selection is d is less than 1 this will fail this will fail this will fail this will fail. So, all of them will fail. So, it is possible that the result of an operation could be either the whole relation as we saw last time or a null relation which has where none of the records will feature because none of the records satisfy the condition. So, there is a basic select operation. Let us move on look at the next one is called the projection operation. So, select chooses a subset of the rows projection necessarily chooses projects a set of columns from the original relation. So, this is a quite straightforward to see it is written in terms of this notation pi and then you write the columns that you want in the result of projection. So, you say this is a c. So, which means basically the column which is not selected in the projection you can simply forget about that simply erase it if you erase that you get this relation. And once you get that please recall that a relation is a set and in a set every element has to be distinct. So, after erasing b this first and the second row have become identical. So, naturally both of them cannot be there it will have to be made distinct by erasing any one of them. And hence they become one row in the result. Obviously, I can project on any of the in fields singly or all the fields also I can do a projection of of this a b c of r of course, that means in this case that will mean that it is a set which is equal to r a given. But obviously, I must have at least one column at least one attribute to project on I cannot project on a null set of attributes because that does not give me a scheme I have. So, there will have to be some attribute one or more attribute on which I project. So, selection and projection selection has given me the set of rows to written and projection has given me what are the columns to written in the result. And combining them I can do several different operations in a database table which can give me several interesting results. Before proceeding further let us look into some of the typical other operations that relational algebra allows. The next one is union given two relations I can take a union this is nothing, but a set thearity union the two relations r and s must have the same set of columns a and b because if the columns are not same then the union does not make sense they because certainly if the columns are different attributes are different their types and type of data values would be different. So, they cannot be put to a same table. So, when two relations have the same set of attributes then their instances can be taken a union of. So, all records that exist in both these relations will be put together into a single table. So, here alpha 1 is coming here beta 1 is coming here in terms of relation alpha 1 is coming here alpha 2 is coming here beta 1 is coming here beta 3 is coming here and alpha 2 is coming here you can see that this record alpha exist in both the relations and by the set theoretic notion of uniqueness in the union they have to be uniqueified. So, one of them will be removed it does not matter because they are identical anyway. So, for relations having the same set of attributes we can simply make a union of all its records. So, other the third operation is a fourth operation is doing a set difference it works simply as set theoretic difference again the two relations must have the same set of attributes and I can do a difference of R minus S which mean that all two pulls which exist in R but do not exist in S will be included. So, this is included because this is not here but this is not included because it is in S this is included because this is this does not exist in the set S. So, it is a set so you take the set R and then erase all the records like this which exist in S and you get R minus S. So, if I look into just to recap if I look into the wind diagram then this is this is a set R minus S which belongs to R but does not belong to S. So, this is a fourth operation that one can do with the in relational algebra. Fifth is a set intersection of two relations. So, again the two relations need to have the same set of attributes you can take their intersection which is the record which belongs to both it is the record that belongs to both of them and as you are aware now set intersection actually is not a new operation it is not a fundamental operation because if I have R if I have S then this is R minus S. Now, if I subtract this R minus S which is this set from R which is this bigger set then what will be remaining this is what will be remaining. So, if I subtract R minus S from R then what will remain is necessarily the intersection of this is R intersection S. So, set intersection is not a fundamental operation of relational algebra but can be used because it can be expressed in terms of set difference. Next comes how can we join two different relations which have different set of attributes. So, relation R has AB and relation S has CDE. So, we can take a Cartesian product. So, taking Cartesian product is making all possible combinations. So, necessarily if since this has two relations and this has three relations. So, this will have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. This has four relations. So, these are 8 total all possible pairing of relations of R or records of R and records of S are included. So, that is a Cartesian product all possible combinations. This is how we can join two relations but certainly what is important is something which we will discuss shortly. Now, in the Cartesian product then issue may happen because there could be attributes which are common between two relations. So, if two attributes are common when you take Cartesian product how do you put their name because as with the example show here between R and S, the attribute B is common. So, how do you take care of that. So, when the such common names happen then we actually change the name of the attribute with the name of the relation. So, B coming from R will be called R dot B and S B coming from S will be called R dot S and accordingly the relational algebra gives you a way to rename a table and put its name differently. So, this is given this is given by this relation given by this symbol rho. So, you can using a relation R you can actually give it a different name S and do that in terms of. So, with that you can actually because otherwise you cannot compute R cross R because if we try to do R cross R then you will have R dot A R dot B and you again have R dot A R dot B. So, you are using this to rename R to S and then compute this. So, renaming a table is another feature which is provided of course, it is not a fundamental operation of the algebra, but this is what makes the any kind of Cartesian product possible. Finally, we can make composition of operations that if for example, what you show here is we have two relations R and S, we have taken a Cartesian product and then we have taken a selection. So, technique Cartesian product of R and S to produce the table as you can see the R cross S and then a selection based on A equal to C based on that condition. So, all these operations can be combined in multiple different ways to give you really complex relational algebra operations. There is a nice operation which is a derived one which can be written in terms of other operations which is called a natural join which we will use very heavily. Let me first show you an example of that. Suppose I have two relations R and S and what is important is there are some attributes which are common between them. Now, we saw earlier that in Cartesian product in terms of common attributes we basically the attributes got renamed in terms of the table name, but this is not what we are looking at in relation natural join. What we want to say is if an attribute is common between two two tables then while you join them the records from two fields can be joined if their value on that common attribute is same. So, it is what it tries to do is it tries to make a Cartesian product of these two tables first take all possible combinations, but then you select only those rows where the values are identical between columns having the same name. So, for example, if you look into this row and this row. So, what will happen in the Cartesian product I will have this alpha 1 alpha a 1 a alpha let me write it in smaller. So, I am doing a Cartesian product I am looking at this row I am looking at this row. So, I have a b c d, i b d e and alpha alpha a 1 a alpha. Now, they match on b they match on d. So, I will say this is this will get retained, but in the Cartesian product I will also have the first row of r going with the second row of s alpha 1 alpha a 3 a beta. Here the b does not match, d does not does match, but the b does not match. So, this particular entry will not go in the final result. So, you take the Cartesian product and you only retain those rows where the values match for the identically named attribute. That is why. So, you take the Cartesian product now look at the expression. The attributes common attributes are b and c b and d. So, the b attribute is r dot b and s dot b. So, you say that in the Cartesian product r dot b must equal s dot b. The name is common the value will have to be same further. Similarly, d is a common attribute. So, r dot d value in the r dot d and the value in the s dot d has to be same. So, based on the Cartesian product you do a selection for equality of values on attributes which are identical between the two columns, between the two relations, within the two tables. This is the final selection. As you do that you get a table where there are two b's r dot b s dot b. There are two d's r dot d s dot d, but according to this selection for all at all records for all rows the value on r dot b and value on s dot b are same. Value on r dot d and value on r s dot d are same because that is how we have done the selection. So, there is no reason to keep two b columns or two d columns. So, now you project based on a r dot b c r dot d and e which means that s dot b and s dot d are left out. You do not project. So, after you have done this projection you get the final result of the natural join which has a union of all the attributes that the two relations at a b c d and b d union is a b c d and you have all those records whose values matched on the common attributes between relation r and relation d. So, you can say that if I now do a selection if I now do a projection on a b c or rather a b c d I will get a subset of r. So, if I do a projection on b d e I will get a subset of s. So, this is the natural join operation in relational algebra as you can see this is a derived operation because we could use the Cartesian product selection and projection to get this, but as I tell you we will see more of when we look at the look at all these different query coding, but natural join is one of the most widely used most fundamental relational algebra operation that you will often need beyond selection and projection. So, these were the six operations and the important derived operations of relational algebra besides that relational algebra has some aggregation operators. For example, given a table we could compute the sum of values on a column, we could compute average of values, max of values, mean of values. So, these somehow aggregate values of multiple rows on a particular column and therefore, these are called aggregate operators. We will see when we talk about SQL, we will see how this really can be coded in SQL and used, but these are this become very convenient to use because often we will need to know if this is I mean these are the instructors and so, let us see which instructor has a maximum load of courses how many based on hours or which instructor has what is average load on the different instructors and so on. So, in every possible context different aggregate operators are frequently required and they are also available as operators in most of the pure as well as commercial query languages. Finally, to note that relational algebra in relational every query input is a table and the output is also a table. So, it is always manipulating one or more tables into a single table that is what we are I mean in very simple terms that is a way you can look at it and all data in the output table appears in one of the input tables that is known new data gets generated. It is basically taking selecting combining data from different input tables it does not generate a new data that is that has to be that is if I see that an attribute for a particular row has a value 15 then there must be some input table where there is a record where in that field there is an attribute value 15 otherwise this cannot happen. Again relational algebra is not turing complete in the sense that there are algorithms which cannot be coded in relational algebra. We mentioned this earlier two and that is the reason that is a foundational reason of why the SQL language commercial SQL language which is based on relational algebra is not turing complete either. So, we might need to use other programming languages along with the relational algebra coding for solving some of the application problems. To summarize this is the so this table is what you not only should remember but you should become an expert of in terms of the operators of relational algebra which we will start using very heavily as we start doing the query coding and processing. So, we talked about selection which takes rows selectively, talked about projection which takes out certain columns of a table. We talked about Cartesian product of two relations which make all possible combined relations. We talked about union of records from two tables having identical set of attributes. We talked about set difference which again is the difference of records of one relation from another given that they have identical set of attributes. We have shown that set difference can be used to also compute set intersection which is not in the fundamental operation but is derived one. And we have shown a very interesting operation based on Cartesian product selection and projection called natural joint where two tables can be joined based on one or more common attributes they have. Now, I am sure you have already noted that if I am doing a natural joint between two tables which do not have any common attribute then the result is merely the Cartesian product because the selection around the Cartesian product has no condition to select any of the you know any of the fields any of the rows separately. So, it merely turns out to be a Cartesian product. So, in this module we have introduced the relational algebra and we have familiarized ourselves with the fundamental and derived operators of relational algebra. Going forward in the next module we will take a deeper look into the relational module and start progressing towards the query design and database design.\"\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"times = []\nfor i, segment in enumerate(result['segments']):\n    start, end = segment['start'], segment['end']\n    print(i)\n    print(f\"00:00:{str(int(start)).replace('.', ',')} --> 00:00:{str(int(end)).replace('.', ',')}\")\n    times.append(int(start))\n    print(segment['text'].strip())\n    print()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.809911Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.810490Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.830665Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.810458Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.829640Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"0\n00:00:18 --> 00:00:23\nWelcome to module 5 of Database Management Systems.\n\n1\n00:00:24 --> 00:00:33\nIn the previous module, we started discussions on introducing relational model. We will conclude\n\n2\n00:00:33 --> 00:00:40\nthat in this module. So, in the last module we have talked about attributes, relational\n\n3\n00:00:41 --> 00:00:48\nschemas and instances in mathematical form and very importantly we have tried to introduce\n\n4\n00:00:48 --> 00:00:55\ndiscuss about the concept of keys. In this module, we will try to understand more on the\n\n5\n00:00:55 --> 00:00:62\nrelational algebra and familiarize with the operations of relational algebra. So, these\n\n6\n00:00:62 --> 00:00:68\nare the different operations that we will look at select project union and so on. Some\n\n7\n00:00:68 --> 00:00:74\nof them are simple set theoretic operations, some are newly defined operations and we look\n\n8\n00:00:74 --> 00:00:82\nat the aggregators. So, relational operators. So, what is a relation? As we have seen already,\n\n9\n00:00:82 --> 00:00:90\na relation is nothing but a table. It has a set of columns and it has a set of rows or records\n\n10\n00:00:90 --> 00:00:102\nthat fill up data according to those columns. Select is an operation which chooses a subset of\n\n11\n00:00:103 --> 00:00:113\nrows from a relation based on a certain condition. So, it is written in terms of in relational\n\n12\n00:00:113 --> 00:00:122\nalgebra we write it with a notion of notation of sigma and following a parenthesis, we put the\n\n13\n00:00:122 --> 00:00:131\nname of the relation. So, we say we are selecting from the relation r and then we put a condition\n\n14\n00:00:131 --> 00:00:152\nhere which is a propositional condition. So, if for this all rows of r will be checked if a row\n\n15\n00:00:153 --> 00:00:161\nwill satisfy this condition, then it will be included in the result. If it does not satisfy the\n\n16\n00:00:161 --> 00:00:168\ncondition, then it will not be included in the result. So, let us look at this example. So,\n\n17\n00:00:168 --> 00:00:180\nour condition is sorry let us put this back. So, our condition theta is a is equal to b and d\n\n18\n00:00:180 --> 00:00:189\nis greater than 5. So, you are saying that that any row to be selected the value of its a\n\n19\n00:00:189 --> 00:00:197\nattribute should equal the value of its b attribute and when that happens the value of its d\n\n20\n00:00:197 --> 00:00:203\nattribute must be greater than 5. So, you can easily if we look through this we can easily say by\n\n21\n00:00:203 --> 00:00:211\nthe first condition a equal to b can say that this row does not satisfy this condition because a\n\n22\n00:00:211 --> 00:00:221\nis alpha and b is beta. Whereas, these three rows satisfy because a is equal to beta, then we again\n\n23\n00:00:221 --> 00:00:234\nlook at d. We find that this d is less than 5. We say this also does not satisfy because it\n\n24\n00:00:234 --> 00:00:241\nfails the second condition both have to hold. So, we finally come to the this record and this\n\n25\n00:00:241 --> 00:00:252\nrecord are the selected record in the result alpha alpha 1 7 alpha alpha 1 7 beta beta 23 10 beta\n\n26\n00:00:252 --> 00:00:261\nbeta 23 10. In both of these records a is equal to b in both of these records d is greater than 5.\n\n27\n00:00:262 --> 00:00:272\nSo, selection is a process is a operation which selects a subset of rows from a table from a\n\n28\n00:00:272 --> 00:00:280\nrelation and creates a new relation based on a selection condition that must be true for all\n\n29\n00:00:280 --> 00:00:287\nthe rows for all the records that have been selected. But the set of columns do not change\n\n30\n00:00:287 --> 00:00:299\nthey remain the same. So, for example, if I if in the contrary if we say that sigma a not equal to b\n\n31\n00:00:299 --> 00:00:314\nr, then naturally I will have a relation which feels a b c d and that relation will be only\n\n32\n00:00:315 --> 00:00:326\nthis row because as the only row where is not equal to b. We can I can have a selection saying r\n\n33\n00:00:327 --> 00:00:339\nwhere c is greater than 0. Naturally this will satisfy this will satisfy this will satisfy this will satisfy.\n\n34\n00:00:341 --> 00:00:348\nSo, this whole relation would be the result of the selection. So, it is possible that it is not\n\n35\n00:00:348 --> 00:00:356\nnecessary that some rows will have to get eliminated in the result. I say that this is\n\n36\n00:00:361 --> 00:00:372\nis the selection is d is less than 1 this will fail this will fail this will fail this will fail.\n\n37\n00:00:374 --> 00:00:381\nSo, all of them will fail. So, it is possible that the result of an operation could be either the\n\n38\n00:00:381 --> 00:00:388\nwhole relation as we saw last time or a null relation which has where none of the records will feature\n\n39\n00:00:388 --> 00:00:397\nbecause none of the records satisfy the condition. So, there is a basic select operation. Let us move on\n\n40\n00:00:397 --> 00:00:404\nlook at the next one is called the projection operation. So, select chooses a subset of the rows\n\n41\n00:00:405 --> 00:00:416\nprojection necessarily chooses projects a set of columns from the original relation.\n\n42\n00:00:418 --> 00:00:425\nSo, this is a quite straightforward to see it is written in terms of this notation pi and then\n\n43\n00:00:425 --> 00:00:434\nyou write the columns that you want in the result of projection. So, you say this is a c.\n\n44\n00:00:436 --> 00:00:442\nSo, which means basically the column which is not selected in the projection you can simply\n\n45\n00:00:442 --> 00:00:448\nforget about that simply erase it if you erase that you get this relation.\n\n46\n00:00:450 --> 00:00:459\nAnd once you get that please recall that a relation is a set and in a set every element has to be\n\n47\n00:00:459 --> 00:00:469\ndistinct. So, after erasing b this first and the second row have become identical. So, naturally\n\n48\n00:00:470 --> 00:00:476\nboth of them cannot be there it will have to be made distinct by erasing any one of them.\n\n49\n00:00:477 --> 00:00:481\nAnd hence they become one row in the result.\n\n50\n00:00:484 --> 00:00:494\nObviously, I can project on any of the in fields singly or all the fields also I can do a projection\n\n51\n00:00:495 --> 00:00:504\nof of this a b c of r of course, that means in this case that will mean that it is a set which\n\n52\n00:00:504 --> 00:00:512\nis equal to r a given. But obviously, I must have at least one column at least one attribute to\n\n53\n00:00:512 --> 00:00:517\nproject on I cannot project on a null set of attributes because that does not give me a scheme\n\n54\n00:00:517 --> 00:00:523\nI have. So, there will have to be some attribute one or more attribute on which I project.\n\n55\n00:00:525 --> 00:00:531\nSo, selection and projection selection has given me the set of rows to written and projection\n\n56\n00:00:532 --> 00:00:537\nhas given me what are the columns to written in the result. And combining them I can do several\n\n57\n00:00:537 --> 00:00:543\ndifferent operations in a database table which can give me several interesting results.\n\n58\n00:00:545 --> 00:00:551\nBefore proceeding further let us look into some of the typical other operations that relational\n\n59\n00:00:551 --> 00:00:558\nalgebra allows. The next one is union given two relations I can take a union this is nothing,\n\n60\n00:00:558 --> 00:00:565\nbut a set thearity union the two relations r and s must have the same set of columns a and b\n\n61\n00:00:566 --> 00:00:572\nbecause if the columns are not same then the union does not make sense they because certainly\n\n62\n00:00:572 --> 00:00:576\nif the columns are different attributes are different their types and type of data values would\n\n63\n00:00:576 --> 00:00:582\nbe different. So, they cannot be put to a same table. So, when two relations have the same set\n\n64\n00:00:582 --> 00:00:592\nof attributes then their instances can be taken a union of. So, all records that exist in\n\n65\n00:00:593 --> 00:00:604\nboth these relations will be put together into a single table. So, here alpha 1 is coming here beta\n\n66\n00:00:604 --> 00:00:616\n1 is coming here in terms of relation alpha 1 is coming here alpha 2 is coming here beta 1 is\n\n67\n00:00:616 --> 00:00:626\ncoming here beta 3 is coming here and alpha 2 is coming here you can see that this record alpha\n\n68\n00:00:626 --> 00:00:636\nexist in both the relations and by the set theoretic notion of uniqueness in the union they have to\n\n69\n00:00:636 --> 00:00:643\nbe uniqueified. So, one of them will be removed it does not matter because they are identical anyway.\n\n70\n00:00:644 --> 00:00:653\nSo, for relations having the same set of attributes we can simply make a union of all its records.\n\n71\n00:00:659 --> 00:00:667\nSo, other the third operation is a fourth operation is doing a set difference it works simply as\n\n72\n00:00:667 --> 00:00:676\nset theoretic difference again the two relations must have the same set of attributes and I can do\n\n73\n00:00:676 --> 00:00:686\na difference of R minus S which mean that all two pulls which exist in R but do not exist in S\n\n74\n00:00:687 --> 00:00:696\nwill be included. So, this is included because this is not here but this is not included because\n\n75\n00:00:697 --> 00:00:705\nit is in S this is included because this is this does not exist in the set S.\n\n76\n00:00:707 --> 00:00:719\nSo, it is a set so you take the set R and then erase all the records like this which exist in S\n\n77\n00:00:720 --> 00:00:729\nand you get R minus S. So, if I look into just to recap if I look into the\n\n78\n00:00:731 --> 00:00:739\nwind diagram then this is this is a set R minus S which belongs to R but does not belong to S.\n\n79\n00:00:739 --> 00:00:747\nSo, this is a fourth operation that one can do with the\n\n80\n00:00:749 --> 00:00:759\nin relational algebra. Fifth is a set intersection of two relations. So, again the two\n\n81\n00:00:759 --> 00:00:765\nrelations need to have the same set of attributes you can take their intersection which is the\n\n82\n00:00:765 --> 00:00:776\nrecord which belongs to both it is the record that belongs to both of them and as you\n\n83\n00:00:778 --> 00:00:785\nare aware now set intersection actually is not a new operation it is not a fundamental operation\n\n84\n00:00:785 --> 00:00:800\nbecause if I have R if I have S then this is R minus S. Now, if I subtract this R minus S which\n\n85\n00:00:800 --> 00:00:810\nis this set from R which is this bigger set then what will be remaining this is what will be\n\n86\n00:00:810 --> 00:00:819\nremaining. So, if I subtract R minus S from R then what will remain is necessarily the intersection\n\n87\n00:00:819 --> 00:00:828\nof this is R intersection S. So, set intersection is not a fundamental operation of relational algebra\n\n88\n00:00:829 --> 00:00:835\nbut can be used because it can be expressed in terms of set difference.\n\n89\n00:00:844 --> 00:00:850\nNext comes how can we join two different relations which have different set of attributes.\n\n90\n00:00:851 --> 00:00:859\nSo, relation R has AB and relation S has CDE. So, we can take a Cartesian product. So,\n\n91\n00:00:859 --> 00:00:865\ntaking Cartesian product is making all possible combinations. So, necessarily if since this has\n\n92\n00:00:865 --> 00:00:875\ntwo relations and this has three relations. So, this will have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. This\n\n93\n00:00:875 --> 00:00:885\nhas four relations. So, these are 8 total all possible pairing of relations of R or records\n\n94\n00:00:885 --> 00:00:891\nof R and records of S are included. So, that is a Cartesian product all possible combinations.\n\n95\n00:00:893 --> 00:00:902\nThis is how we can join two relations but certainly what is important is something which we\n\n96\n00:00:902 --> 00:00:908\nwill discuss shortly. Now, in the Cartesian product then issue may happen because\n\n97\n00:00:909 --> 00:00:915\nthere could be attributes which are common between two relations. So, if two attributes are common\n\n98\n00:00:915 --> 00:00:920\nwhen you take Cartesian product how do you put their name because as with the example show here\n\n99\n00:00:920 --> 00:00:927\nbetween R and S, the attribute B is common. So, how do you take care of that. So, when the\n\n100\n00:00:927 --> 00:00:934\nsuch common names happen then we actually change the name of the attribute with the name of the\n\n101\n00:00:934 --> 00:00:942\nrelation. So, B coming from R will be called R dot B and S B coming from S will be called R dot\n\n102\n00:00:942 --> 00:00:954\nS and accordingly the relational algebra gives you a way to rename a table and put its name\n\n103\n00:00:954 --> 00:00:966\ndifferently. So, this is given this is given by this relation given by this symbol rho.\n\n104\n00:00:967 --> 00:00:978\nSo, you can using a relation R you can actually give it a different name S and do that in terms of.\n\n105\n00:00:979 --> 00:00:987\nSo, with that you can actually because otherwise you cannot compute R cross R because if we try to\n\n106\n00:00:987 --> 00:00:994\ndo R cross R then you will have R dot A R dot B and you again have R dot A R dot B. So, you are\n\n107\n00:00:994 --> 00:00:1002\nusing this to rename R to S and then compute this. So, renaming a table is another feature which\n\n108\n00:00:1002 --> 00:00:1009\nis provided of course, it is not a fundamental operation of the algebra, but this is what makes\n\n109\n00:00:1009 --> 00:00:1019\nthe any kind of Cartesian product possible. Finally, we can make composition of operations\n\n110\n00:00:1020 --> 00:00:1027\nthat if for example, what you show here is we have two relations R and S, we have taken a Cartesian\n\n111\n00:00:1027 --> 00:00:1034\nproduct and then we have taken a selection. So, technique Cartesian product of R and S to produce\n\n112\n00:00:1034 --> 00:00:1042\nthe table as you can see the R cross S and then a selection based on A equal to C based on that\n\n113\n00:00:1042 --> 00:00:1048\ncondition. So, all these operations can be combined in multiple different ways to give you\n\n114\n00:00:1048 --> 00:00:1058\nreally complex relational algebra operations. There is a nice operation which is a derived one\n\n115\n00:00:1058 --> 00:00:1065\nwhich can be written in terms of other operations which is called a natural join which we will use\n\n116\n00:00:1065 --> 00:00:1074\nvery heavily. Let me first show you an example of that. Suppose I have two relations R and S\n\n117\n00:00:1075 --> 00:00:1081\nand what is important is there are some attributes which are common between them.\n\n118\n00:00:1084 --> 00:00:1092\nNow, we saw earlier that in Cartesian product in terms of common attributes we basically the\n\n119\n00:00:1092 --> 00:00:1096\nattributes got renamed in terms of the table name, but this is not what we are looking at in\n\n120\n00:00:1096 --> 00:00:1104\nrelation natural join. What we want to say is if an attribute is common between two two\n\n121\n00:00:1104 --> 00:00:1116\ntables then while you join them the records from two fields can be joined if their value\n\n122\n00:00:1117 --> 00:00:1128\non that common attribute is same. So, it is what it tries to do is it tries to make a Cartesian\n\n123\n00:00:1128 --> 00:00:1137\nproduct of these two tables first take all possible combinations, but then you select only those\n\n124\n00:00:1137 --> 00:00:1149\nrows where the values are identical between columns having the same name. So, for example, if you\n\n125\n00:00:1149 --> 00:00:1159\nlook into this row and this row. So, what will happen in the Cartesian product I will have\n\n126\n00:00:1163 --> 00:00:1174\nthis alpha 1 alpha a 1 a alpha let me write it in smaller. So, I am doing a Cartesian product\n\n127\n00:00:1175 --> 00:00:1190\nI am looking at this row I am looking at this row. So, I have a b c d, i b d e and alpha alpha a 1 a\n\n128\n00:00:1190 --> 00:00:1201\nalpha. Now, they match on b they match on d. So, I will say this is this will get retained,\n\n129\n00:00:1202 --> 00:00:1211\nbut in the Cartesian product I will also have the first row of r going with the second row of s\n\n130\n00:00:1212 --> 00:00:1226\nalpha 1 alpha a 3 a beta. Here the b does not match, d does not does match, but the b does not match.\n\n131\n00:00:1230 --> 00:00:1240\nSo, this particular entry will not go in the final result. So, you take the Cartesian product\n\n132\n00:00:1241 --> 00:00:1251\nand you only retain those rows where the values match for the identically named attribute.\n\n133\n00:00:1253 --> 00:00:1256\nThat is why. So, you take the Cartesian product now look at the expression.\n\n134\n00:00:1258 --> 00:00:1269\nThe attributes common attributes are b and c b and d. So, the b attribute is r dot b and s dot b.\n\n135\n00:00:1269 --> 00:00:1276\nSo, you say that in the Cartesian product r dot b must equal s dot b. The name is common the\n\n136\n00:00:1276 --> 00:00:1283\nvalue will have to be same further. Similarly, d is a common attribute. So, r dot d value in the r\n\n137\n00:00:1283 --> 00:00:1291\ndot d and the value in the s dot d has to be same. So, based on the Cartesian product you do a\n\n138\n00:00:1291 --> 00:00:1301\nselection for equality of values on attributes which are identical between the two columns,\n\n139\n00:00:1301 --> 00:00:1306\nbetween the two relations, within the two tables. This is the final selection.\n\n140\n00:00:1308 --> 00:00:1315\nAs you do that you get a table where there are two b's r dot b s dot b.\n\n141\n00:00:1316 --> 00:00:1325\nThere are two d's r dot d s dot d, but according to this selection for all at all records for all rows\n\n142\n00:00:1326 --> 00:00:1333\nthe value on r dot b and value on s dot b are same. Value on r dot d and value on r s dot d are same\n\n143\n00:00:1334 --> 00:00:1341\nbecause that is how we have done the selection. So, there is no reason to keep two b columns or two\n\n144\n00:00:1341 --> 00:00:1353\nd columns. So, now you project based on a r dot b c r dot d and e which means that s dot b\n\n145\n00:00:1355 --> 00:00:1366\nand s dot d are left out. You do not project. So, after you have done this projection you get the\n\n146\n00:00:1366 --> 00:00:1375\nfinal result of the natural join which has a union of all the attributes that the two relations\n\n147\n00:00:1375 --> 00:00:1389\nat a b c d and b d union is a b c d and you have all those records whose values matched on the\n\n148\n00:00:1389 --> 00:00:1396\ncommon attributes between relation r and relation d. So, you can say that if I now do a selection\n\n149\n00:00:1396 --> 00:00:1403\nif I now do a projection on a b c or rather a b c d I will get a subset of r.\n\n150\n00:00:1405 --> 00:00:1413\nSo, if I do a projection on b d e I will get a subset of s. So, this is the natural join operation\n\n151\n00:00:1413 --> 00:00:1419\nin relational algebra as you can see this is a derived operation because we could use the\n\n152\n00:00:1420 --> 00:00:1426\nCartesian product selection and projection to get this, but as I tell you we will see more of\n\n153\n00:00:1427 --> 00:00:1436\nwhen we look at the look at all these different query coding, but natural join is one of the most\n\n154\n00:00:1437 --> 00:00:1441\nwidely used most fundamental relational algebra operation that you will often need beyond\n\n155\n00:00:1442 --> 00:00:1449\nselection and projection. So, these were the six operations and the important derived operations\n\n156\n00:00:1449 --> 00:00:1453\nof relational algebra besides that relational algebra has some aggregation operators.\n\n157\n00:00:1455 --> 00:00:1462\nFor example, given a table we could compute the sum of values on a column, we could compute\n\n158\n00:00:1462 --> 00:00:1468\naverage of values, max of values, mean of values. So, these somehow aggregate values of multiple\n\n159\n00:00:1469 --> 00:00:1475\nrows on a particular column and therefore, these are called aggregate operators.\n\n160\n00:00:1476 --> 00:00:1483\nWe will see when we talk about SQL, we will see how this really can be coded in SQL and used,\n\n161\n00:00:1483 --> 00:00:1488\nbut these are this become very convenient to use because often we will need to know\n\n162\n00:00:1488 --> 00:00:1496\nif this is I mean these are the instructors and so, let us see which instructor has a maximum\n\n163\n00:00:1496 --> 00:00:1504\nload of courses how many based on hours or which instructor has what is average load\n\n164\n00:00:1504 --> 00:00:1509\non the different instructors and so on. So, in every possible context different aggregate\n\n165\n00:00:1509 --> 00:00:1514\noperators are frequently required and they are also available as operators in most of the\n\n166\n00:00:1514 --> 00:00:1524\npure as well as commercial query languages. Finally, to note that relational algebra in relational\n\n167\n00:00:1524 --> 00:00:1534\nevery query input is a table and the output is also a table. So, it is always manipulating one\n\n168\n00:00:1534 --> 00:00:1540\nor more tables into a single table that is what we are I mean in very simple terms that is a\n\n169\n00:00:1540 --> 00:00:1547\nway you can look at it and all data in the output table appears in one of the input tables that\n\n170\n00:00:1547 --> 00:00:1556\nis known new data gets generated. It is basically taking selecting combining data from different\n\n171\n00:00:1556 --> 00:00:1563\ninput tables it does not generate a new data that is that has to be that is if I see that\n\n172\n00:00:1564 --> 00:00:1571\nan attribute for a particular row has a value 15 then there must be some input table where there\n\n173\n00:00:1571 --> 00:00:1576\nis a record where in that field there is an attribute value 15 otherwise this cannot happen.\n\n174\n00:00:1578 --> 00:00:1583\nAgain relational algebra is not turing complete in the sense that there are algorithms which cannot\n\n175\n00:00:1583 --> 00:00:1590\nbe coded in relational algebra. We mentioned this earlier two and that is the reason that is a\n\n176\n00:00:1590 --> 00:00:1596\nfoundational reason of why the SQL language commercial SQL language which is based on relational\n\n177\n00:00:1596 --> 00:00:1602\nalgebra is not turing complete either. So, we might need to use other programming languages along\n\n178\n00:00:1602 --> 00:00:1607\nwith the relational algebra coding for solving some of the application problems.\n\n179\n00:00:1609 --> 00:00:1615\nTo summarize this is the so this table is what you not only should remember but you should\n\n180\n00:00:1615 --> 00:00:1621\nbecome an expert of in terms of the operators of relational algebra which we will start using very\n\n181\n00:00:1621 --> 00:00:1628\nheavily as we start doing the query coding and processing. So, we talked about selection which\n\n182\n00:00:1628 --> 00:00:1633\ntakes rows selectively, talked about projection which takes out certain columns of a table.\n\n183\n00:00:1634 --> 00:00:1641\nWe talked about Cartesian product of two relations which make all possible combined relations.\n\n184\n00:00:1642 --> 00:00:1647\nWe talked about union of records from two tables having identical set of attributes.\n\n185\n00:00:1648 --> 00:00:1658\nWe talked about set difference which again is the difference of records of one relation\n\n186\n00:00:1659 --> 00:00:1666\nfrom another given that they have identical set of attributes. We have shown that set difference\n\n187\n00:00:1666 --> 00:00:1672\ncan be used to also compute set intersection which is not in the fundamental operation but is\n\n188\n00:00:1672 --> 00:00:1679\nderived one. And we have shown a very interesting operation based on Cartesian product selection\n\n189\n00:00:1680 --> 00:00:1687\nand projection called natural joint where two tables can be joined based on one or more common\n\n190\n00:00:1687 --> 00:00:1692\nattributes they have. Now, I am sure you have already noted that if I am doing a natural\n\n191\n00:00:1693 --> 00:00:1699\njoint between two tables which do not have any common attribute then the result is merely the\n\n192\n00:00:1699 --> 00:00:1704\nCartesian product because the selection around the Cartesian product has no condition to select\n\n193\n00:00:1705 --> 00:00:1713\nany of the you know any of the fields any of the rows separately. So, it merely turns out to be\n\n194\n00:00:1713 --> 00:00:1724\na Cartesian product. So, in this module we have introduced the relational algebra and we have\n\n195\n00:00:1724 --> 00:00:1731\nfamiliarized ourselves with the fundamental and derived operators of relational algebra.\n\n196\n00:00:1732 --> 00:00:1738\nGoing forward in the next module we will take a deeper look into the relational module and\n\n197\n00:00:1738 --> 00:00:1743\nstart progressing towards the query design and database design.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"len(times)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.832142Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.832673Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.846808Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.832640Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.845887Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"execution_count":10,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"198"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import cv2\nimport os\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n#path to save images\npath = r'/kaggle/working/'\nos.chdir(path)\n\ni = 0\n\nvideo = cv2.VideoCapture('/kaggle/input/dbms-dataset/Introduction to Relational Model_2.mp4')\n\nfps = video.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)\nprint('frames per second =',fps)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.848164Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.848628Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.928682Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.848596Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.927725Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"frames per second = 29.97002997002997\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for i in times:\n        \n    frame_id = int(fps*( i))\n#     print('frame id =',frame_id)\n    video.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES, frame_id)\n    ret, frame = video.read()\n    \n    cv2.imwrite(str(i)+ '.png', frame)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.932093Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.932382Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.931398Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T18:52:12.932358Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.930234Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# # reducing frames\n\n# threshold = 20.0\n\n# frame =  cv2.imread(\"/kaggle/working/14.png\")\n# prev = frame\n\n# for i in times:\n    \n#     frame = \"/kaggle/working/\" + str(i) +\".png\"\n    \n#     if ((np.sum(np.absolute(frame - prev))//np.size(frame)) > threshold) :\n        \n#         cv2.imwrite('new' + str(i)+ '.png', frame)\n#         prev= frame\n    \n#     else:\n#         prev = frame\n        \n        \n#  # cv2.read(str(i)+ '.png')\n        ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.933709Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.934457Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.939490Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.934420Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.938536Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# select unique images\n# generate  text from image OCR\n# ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.941390Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.941870Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.956074Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.941833Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.955010Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# text recognition\nimport cv2\nimport pytesseract\n\n# read image\nimg = cv2.imread('/kaggle/working/122.png')\n\n# configurations\nconfig = ('-l eng --oem 1 --psm 3')\n\n# pytessercat\ntext = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, config=config)\n\n# print text\ntext = text.split('\\n')\nprint(text)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.957200Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.957552Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T18:52:51.972452Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T18:52:50.957519Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T18:52:51.971476Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"['SWAYAM: NPTEL-NOC MOOCs Instructor: Prof. P P Das, IIT Kharagpur.
